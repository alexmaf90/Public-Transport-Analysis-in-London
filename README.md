## About

This project showcases my data science skills and expertise in analyzing transportation data. By exploring diverse datasets related to London's transport system, I aim to gain valuable insights and demonstrate my ability to derive meaningful conclusions from complex data.

## Datasets

The project utilizes the following datasets:

- `london_merged.csv`: Bike trips data, including starting hour, day of the week, and month.
- `tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx`: Daily bicycle hires data in London.
- `air-quality-london.xlsx`: Monthly average air quality measurements in London.
- `tfl-journeys-type April 2010 - May 2022.xlsx`: Number of journeys by different transport modes.
- `fuel_consumption.csv`: Fuel consumption data by various vehicle types.
- `transport.csv`: Number of trips by different modes of transport.
- `LAEI2016_MajorRoads_EmissionsbyLink_2010.xlsb`, `LAEI2016_MajorRoads_EmissionsbyLink_2013.xlsb`, `LAEI2016_MajorRoads_EmissionsbyLink_2016.xlsb`: Emissions data by different vehicle types.

## Analysis and Visualizations

The project presents a wide range of analyses and visualizations, providing meaningful insights into London's transportation system. Here are some key highlights:

- Bike trips by starting hour: Discover the distribution of bike trips throughout the day.
- Bike trips on weekends and weekdays: Compare bike usage patterns on weekends and weekdays.
- Bike trips by day of the week: Explore the popularity of bike trips on different days.
- Bike trips by month: Identify trends in bike trips over the course of the year.
- Bike trips by temperature: Investigate the relationship between temperature and bike usage.


## Conclusion

The analysis of London's transport data provides valuable insights into various aspects of the transportation system, including bike trips, public transport usage, fuel consumption, air quality, and emissions. This project showcases my skills in data analysis, visualization, and deriving meaningful insights from complex datasets.
